# Data Analytics Provisioning, Importing, Extracting and Manipulation: BIDA405

Dates: 2020-09-05 to 2020-10-11
Time:  9:00 am–12:00 pm
Days: Saturday, Sunday



## Prerequisites

It is recommended that students have completed BIDA301 Business Intelligence and Data Analytics Fundamentals or have basic experience coding in R or Python as well as experience using formulas in Excel.

## Course description

This course will explore the fundamentals of coding and scripting for Data Analytics. You will develop the ability to script and code for basic tasks in Data Analytics in common data analytic tools such as SQL, R, Python, and Excel. This will allow you to import and export data appropriately and perform fundamental data manipulations and to automate basic analysis elements.

### Learning objectives

* Construct complex scripts in R, Python and SQL to solve problems.

* Apply appropriate safeguards for data privacy and security

Perform the following basic tasks in R, Python, and SQL as appropriate:

* Import and export data

* Clean data

* Compile data

* Extract data

* Manipulate data

* Prepare data for visualization and reporting

## Course Philosophy

Analysis of data helps us make better decisions. And computers have accelerated how much data we can analyze.

The emphasis in this course will be on the data itself: where it comes from, how it is encoded, how it is stored, extracted, transformed, and loaded into tools that facilitate modeling, visualization, and communication. 

In this course we will be primarily using the open source programming language R, with tangents into SQL and Python.
