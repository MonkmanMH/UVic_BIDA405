## Course content

**R and RStudio:**

* This course uses the statistical software R and the integrated development environment (IDE) program RStudio. Both are free to use and open-source.

* For instructions on how to install R and RStudio on your computer, please click these links (from the book _R Cookbook_ (2nd edition) by Paul Teetor and JD Long): 

  - ["Downloading and Installing R"](https://rc2e.com/gettingstarted#recipe-id001) . 

  - ["Installing RStudio"](https://rc2e.com/gettingstarted#recipe-id002b). 

  - Note that you'll want the "RStudio Desktop" (not "RStudio Server") free version


* Danielle Navarro, [_running R on your own computer_](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRPB0ZzEYegOZivdelOuEn-R-XUN-DOjd)

  - A series of videos on youtube, with installation instructions for different operating systems (Mac, Windows, and Ubuntu linux), as well as loading and installing packages from both CRAN and GitHub (where many in-development packages are available)


* Once you have installed R and RStudio, open RStudio...the program will look something like this. (Because both R and RStudio are in a constant state of development, yours will be different!)

* We will cover installing R _packages_ (extensions to the core program) in the first class. But if you want to give it a try before we first meet, you can now install some of the packages that we will be using in this course. This link explains about [R packages](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/packages2.html). 

To install the package called "tidyverse", type

`install.packages("tidyverse")`

in the "Console" pane (you'll see the cursor in the bottom left of your screen). Once you press enter, the console text will initiate the progress downloading and installing of a number of packages.

Well done!




**Textbook and readings:** 

* There isn't a single resource that would serve as a good textbook for BIDA 405.

* A variety of readings and reference materials will be introduced with each lesson. These materials will be either freely available online or accessed through your UVic Library account.
