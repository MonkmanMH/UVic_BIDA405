## Course content

**R and RStudio:**

* This course uses the statistical software R and the integrated development environment (IDE) program RStudio. Both are free to use and open-source.

* To install R and RStudio on your computer, please click this link: ["Installing R and RStudio"](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html) (from the book _Hands-On Programming with R_ by Garrett Grolemund). Note that you'll want the "RStudio Desktop" (not "RStudio Server") free version

* Once you have installed R and RStudio, open RStudio...the program will look something like this. (Because both R and RStudio are in a constant state of development, yours will be different!)

* We will cover installing R _packages_ (extensions to the core program) in the first class. But if you want to give it a try before we first meet, you can now install some of packages that we will be using in this course. This link explains about [R packages](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/packages2.html). 

To install the package called "tidyverse", type

`install.packages("tidyverse")`

in the "Console" pane (you'll see the cursor in the bottom left of your screen). Once you press enter, the console text will initiate the progress downloading and installing of a number of packages.

Well done!



**Moodle:**

* This course uses Moodle—an online learning management system—as a supplementary resource for the class. 

* To access, login to [https://distance.moodle.uvcs.uvic.ca/](https://distance.moodle.uvcs.uvic.ca/) with your Netlink ID.


**Textbook and readings:** 

* There isn't a single resource that would serve as a good textbook for BIDA 405.

* A variety of readings and reference materials will be introduced with each lesson. These materials will be either freely available online or accessed through your UVic Library account.
