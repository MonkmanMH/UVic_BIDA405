# What data scientists do


> Data scientists spend 60% of their time on cleaning and organizing data. Collecting data sets comes second at 19% of their time, meaning data scientists spend around 80% of their time on preparing and managing data for analysis.

## Loading a package

There are two steps to getting a package ready to use:

1. download and install

`install.packages()`

Our RStudio environment has all the packages you'll need!

2. load

`library()`

##getting help

In the console, typing a question mark (?) and a package or function brings up the Help info (bottom right pane)

Type the following:

`?mpg`

Or, once a package is loaded, it is accessible through the Help pane (bottom right) and will auto-fill once you start typing
