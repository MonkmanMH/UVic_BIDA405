## README

A short plain text file with project details

## Literate programming

Don't document your code: instead, code your documentation

* "a brief explanatory comment at the start of each script"

---
class: inverse

## Strategy for literate programming

### 1. create an outline of the basic plan

### 2. then add steps within the plan

### 3. then add some text detail for each step

### 4. and then write the code
